# TiltedCircle

This is my first project game made with Unity.
I couldnâ€™t post all the game material here, obviously, so these folders are just some important game assets(scenes, prefabs and scripts).

This is a simple 99.9% impossible game that I made just to learn a little bit about Unity and how to create a game.
